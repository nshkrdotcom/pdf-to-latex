Neo4j Setup Procedure

Installation: Download and install Neo4j Desktop or Neo4j Server Community Edition (for production).

Create a Database: In Neo4j Desktop, create a new project and add a local DBMS. Alternatively, if you are using Neo4j Server, a database will be created when the server starts.

Connect to the Database: Note the connection details (URI, username, password). The default uri is usually bolt://localhost:7687. The default username is neo4j, and the default password you will have set during the installation process.

Create Constraints (Important): Connect to your Neo4j database (using the Neo4j Browser or a Python driver) and execute the Cypher commands from the schema file to create the uniqueness constraints:

CREATE CONSTRAINT doc_id_unique ON (d:Document) ASSERT d.doc_id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT page_id_unique ON (p:Page) ASSERT p.page_id IS UNIQUE;
CREATE CONSTRAINT block_id_unique ON (b:Block) ASSERT b.block_id IS UNIQUE;
content_copy
Use code with caution.
Cypher

Integrate with your Python Code: Use the py2neo library in your Python code to connect to the database and interact with it (as shown in the persistence_layer.py example).

Key improvements in persistence_layer.py:

**kwargs for create_block_node: The create_block_node function now accepts **kwargs. This allows you to pass additional properties to the block nodes dynamically, such as text_content, font_family, etc., depending on the block_type. This makes the function much more flexible.

Clearer Example: The example usage is more complete and shows how to create nodes and a relationship.

clear_database() function: A helper function to clear all nodes and relationships in the database was added. This is useful for testing and resetting the database to a clean state.

Error Handling (Important â€“ Add this): The provided code lacks robust error handling. You must add error handling (e.g., try...except blocks) to gracefully handle potential issues like connection errors, invalid queries, or data integrity violations.

This improved code and setup procedure provide a better starting point for interacting with Neo4j in your PDF-to-LaTeX pipeline. Remember to tailor the schema, code, and setup to your specific needs, and always prioritize robust error handling and data validation.
