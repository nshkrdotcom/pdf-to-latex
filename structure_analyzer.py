            list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a block

        # 1. Regular Expressions for Basic Structure:
        # Use regular expressions to identify headings, lists, paragraphs, etc.

        # Example: Find headings (adjust regex as needed)
        for match in re.finditer(r"^(#+\s*)(.*?)$", text, re.MULTILINE): # Example heading detection.  Customize the regex!

        # 2. NLP Techniques (Optional but recommended):
        # Use NLP to enhance structure identification (e.g., sentence segmentation, named entity recognition)
        # Example (using spaCy):
        # if using spacy
        # nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")  # Load your spaCy model
        # doc = nlp(text)
        # for sent in doc.sents:
        #     # Analyze sentences, identify entities, etc.
        #     pass

        # 3. Layout Analysis (Advanced):
        # If you have bounding box information from OCR, use it for layout analysis
        # (e.g., identify columns, tables, figures based on position).


        # Example: Handling Paragraphs (after headings, lists, etc. are extracted)
        remaining_text = text # Update this as you extract elements
        for paragraph in remaining_text.split("\n\n"): # split into paragraphs
            paragraph = paragraph.strip()
            if paragraph: # Add non-empty paragraph
                blocks.append({"type": "paragraph", "content": paragraph})


        return blocks

    # ... (Add more specialized functions for tables, figures, equations, etc.)


# Example usage in your main pipeline:

# ... (get extracted text from pdf_parser)

# analyzer = StructureAnalyzer()
# for page_num, text in extracted_text.items():
#     page_blocks = analyzer.analyze_text(text)
#     # ... store or process the blocks (e.g., in the persistence layer) ...
